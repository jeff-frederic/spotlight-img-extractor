# Windows10 LockScreen Image Extractor
Extract Windows10 lock screen images for viewing and keeping. 

Have you ever logged onto your Windows 10 device and seen a beautiful lock screen image, just to never see it again? That was exactly my problem. I needed a way of finding these beautiful images in my system, formatting them correctly and saving them to my device without the hassle of having to dig deep into my User/ directories. So, I made this program. Enjoy :)
